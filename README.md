> Hello there! My name is Neil, and I come from the Darien, CT. Currently, I am a senior at Lehigh University, on the verge of completing my studies in economics. But let me tell you, my passions extend far beyond the realms of numbers and graphs.

> You see, my heart beats to the rhythm of three distinct realms: cars, books, and mountain biking. When it comes to cars, I can't help but be enamored by the engineering marvels that power these four-wheeled wonders. Whether it's the sleek lines of a classic sports car or the cutting-edge innovations of electric vehicles, I find myself immersed in the ever-evolving world of automotive technology.

> Ah, books! With every turn of the page, I find myself transported to far-off places and introduced to extraordinary characters. From the realms of fiction to the depths of non-fiction, I relish the knowledge and inspiration that each book bestows upon me.

> But there's more to me than just a love for cars, books and mountainbiking. In addition to my passions for cars, books, and mountain biking, I am deeply fascinated by the world of finance and investments. Specifically, I have a keen interest in portfolio management and public equities.

### World Population by Country
>Raj Kumar Pandey published this dataset 19 days ago on Kaggle.com

>According to the US Census Bureau's world population clock, the global population was estimated to be 7,922,312,800 people as of September 2022. It was projected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of the same year. This is significantly higher than the world population of 7.2 billion in 2015. The world's population continues to grow, with around 140 people being added per minute, mainly due to more births than deaths in most countries.

>However, the population growth rate has been decreasing for many decades. This trend is expected to continue until the population growth rate reaches zero, meaning an equal number of births and deaths around 2080-2100. At that point, the population is estimated to be around 10.4 billion people. Afterward, the population growth rate is predicted to become negative, resulting in a decline in the global population.
