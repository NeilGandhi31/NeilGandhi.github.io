> Hello there! My name is Neil, and I come from the Darien, CT. Currently, I am a senior at Lehigh University, on the verge of completing my studies in economics. But let me tell you, my passions extend far beyond the realms of numbers and graphs.

> You see, my heart beats to the rhythm of three distinct realms: cars, books, and mountain biking. When it comes to cars, I can't help but be enamored by the engineering marvels that power these four-wheeled wonders. Whether it's the sleek lines of a classic sports car or the cutting-edge innovations of electric vehicles, I find myself immersed in the ever-evolving world of automotive technology.

> Ah, books! With every turn of the page, I find myself transported to far-off places and introduced to extraordinary characters. From the realms of fiction to the depths of non-fiction, I relish the knowledge and inspiration that each book bestows upon me.

> But there's more to me than just a love for cars, books and mountainbiking. In addition to my passions for cars, books, and mountain biking, I am deeply fascinated by the world of finance and investments. Specifically, I have a keen interest in portfolio management and public equities.
